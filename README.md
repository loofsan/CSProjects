# **My Coding Journey**

Welcome to my coding repository! This repository is a collection of all the coding projects, assignments, and lessons I've worked on over the years. 
It represents my growth and knowledge in various programming languages and technologies. 
From classwork to random assignments from online lessons, this repository is a testament to my learning journey.

## **Introduction**

This repository is a comprehensive archive of my coding endeavors. 
It includes everything from simple scripts to complex projects, showcasing my skills and 
knowledge in various programming languages. Whether it's class assignments, random online 
lessons, or personal projects, you'll find it all here. Of course, it doesn't fully cover all the languages I have
worked with as some of them are websites and engineering projects. 

## **Languages and Technologies**
Here's a list of the languages and technologies I've worked with and are included in this repository:

## **Classwork**
These are all the classworks I've done at my local community college. There are 4 classes I've uploaded on this repository. 

### [**CIS-117**](/CIS-117) 
This is a *Introductory Python Programming* course I took. 
Inside the folder, there is another folder, [***Python***](/CIS-117/Python), which consists of all the Python coding assignments and projects that I've done over the years over online courses and such.

### [**COMP-252**](/COMP-252) 
This is a *Intro to Data Structures: C++* course I took. 

### [**COMP-284**](/COMP-284) 
This is a *Intro to Object-Oriented Programming: Java* course I took. 

### [**COMP-286**](/COMP-286) 
This is a *Intro to Data Structures: Java* course I took. 

## **Projects**

### [**Beacon**](/Beacon)
This is the project created for SFHacks 2025 - Tech For Good. The Resource Overflow was inspired from challenges that underserved populations face when trying to access critical services. Many people in need don't know where to find help and what kind of help exists. Additionally, existing resource directories are often difficult to navigate. I wanted to create a solution that uses technology to connect people with the resources they need in a simple way that prioritizes accessibility and utility.

### [**Vocis**](/Vocis) 
Built a voice-empathetic recognition software aimed for vocal coaching for CalHacks v11.0 using Hume.AI mainly. 

### [**AP Exam Policy Extension**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/uc-ap-exam-policy-checker/lhmkeccgiphdegpelmommddcdlnpoaee?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar)
Created a chrome extension to easily check AP exam policies from the UC website

### [**SkylineModelingSite**](https://skylinemodelingbookingsite.onrender.com/)
Created a website for Barbering, Cosmetology, Esthetics program at Skyline College

### [**Demonstration Of Photo-Electric Effect Using PhotoDiodes & LEDs**](https://sites.google.com/my.smccd.edu/group11projectportfolio/home)
Used LEDs to observe whether the efficiency of electricity transferred has a direct and proportional relationship with the wavelength of the light that falls on the object

### [**Exploring Solutions to the Schrödinger Equation in a Finite Potential Box**](/SchrodingerEquation)
This project explores solutions to the three-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation for a particle confined in a finite potential box. The goal is to visualize quantized energy levels using heatmaps and 3-dimensional models. By focusing on the hydrogen atom, we aim to enhance our understanding of the interplay between quantum mechanics and physical phenomena.
