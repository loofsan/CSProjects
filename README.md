# **My Coding Journey**

Welcome to my coding repository! This repository is a collection of all the coding projects, assignments, and lessons I've worked on over the years. 
It represents my growth and knowledge in various programming languages and technologies. 
From classwork to random assignments from online lessons, this repository is a testament to my learning journey.

## **Introduction**

This repository is a comprehensive archive of my coding endeavors. 
It includes everything from simple scripts to complex projects, showcasing my skills and 
knowledge in various programming languages. Whether it's class assignments, random online 
lessons, or personal projects, you'll find it all here. Of course, it doesn't fully cover all the languages I have
worked with as some of them are websites and engineering projects.
