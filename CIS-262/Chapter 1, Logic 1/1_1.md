# Introduction

**Logic** is the study of formal reasoning. 
A **Proposition** is a statement that is either true or false.

### Example of propositions:
There are infinite number of prime numbers. True
17 is an even number. False

A proposition's **truth value** is a value indicating whether the proposition is actually true or false. 

## Conjunction Operation

**Propositional variables** such as *p*, *q*, *r* can be used ot denote arbitrary propositions, as in: 

*p*: January has 31 days.
*q*: February has 33 days.

A **compound proposition** is created by connecting the individual propositions with logical operations. 

A **logical operation** combines propositions using a particular composition rule. 

### Conjunction Operation = ∧

*p* ∧ *q* is read "p and q" nad is called the **conjunction** of p and q.

*p* ∧ *q* is true if both *p* is true and *q* is true.

*p* ∧ *q* is false if both *p* is false and *q* is false.
