1. Line 1 creates a class named “CalculateArea”.

2. “main” in Line 3 is a method that is part of the class, “CalculateArea”.

3. The braces, “{” and “}”, are to end the method and the class. 

4. Yes, it would not print out anything because the print line doesn’t have brackets.
   "System.out.print ("A rectangle has a length of " + rectangleLength" has no brackets at the end.

6. “int” means integer in Line 5 and Line 6.

7. In Line 8, there are quotation marks around things we want to use as Strings so that it prints out exactly the way we wanted to. 
   Some of them don’t have quotation marks because we want to use the value of the variable.

8. The “+” in Line 8 combines or concatenates the strings and variables together in a sentence.

9. Line 9 closes the method.
